# Runge Kutta 4
 
 The main function (P1Z24_LSZ_runge-kutta.m) is olving linear differential equations of any order, in the form of a_m(x)*y^(m) + a_m-1(x)*y(m-1)+...+a_1(x)*y'+a_0(x)*y = b(x), using the iterative Runge-Kutta method of 4th order (the 3/8 formula).

There are 3 tests (test*.m), that check correctness of the program.
Other tests (test_num_*.m) verify the numerical properties of this method.
There is also a report (P1Z24_LSZ.pdf) from this project written in polish.
