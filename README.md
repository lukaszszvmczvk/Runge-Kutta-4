# Runge Kutta 4
 
Numerical methods projedt implementing 4h order Runge-Kutta (3/8) method to evaluate differential equation.
There are 3 tests (test*.m), that check correctness of the program.
Other tests (test_num_*.m) verify the numerical properties of this method.
There is also a report (P1Z24_LSZ.pdf) from this project written in polish.
